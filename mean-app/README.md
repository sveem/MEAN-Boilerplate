# MEAN Stack Boilerplate

MEAN stack app boilerplate - MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node.js

## Frontend
- Angular - TypeScript-based open-source front-end web application platform led by Angular Team at Google
- Angular Material Design - Collection of Google's Material Design components 

## Backend
- Node.js - Open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment built on Chrome's V8
- Express - Minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework

## Databases
- MongoDB with Mongoose - NoSQL free and open-source, cross-platform document-oriented database
- Firebase - Mobile and web application development platform supported by Google

## Tests
- Mocha - Feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js
- Karma - Test runner for JavaScript that runs on Node.js. It's very well suited to testing Angular projects.
- Jasmine - Testing framework that supports Behaviour Driven Development

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
